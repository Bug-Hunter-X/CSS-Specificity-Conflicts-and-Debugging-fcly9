To solve this, you can make your intended styles more specific by adding more selectors, or use the `!important` flag (though use it sparingly and be aware of potential negative consequences).  Here's an example of making your selectors more specific:

/* bug.css */
.my-element { color: blue; }
#my-element { color: red; }

/* bugSolution.css */
#my-element { color: red; }
.my-element#my-element {color: red !important;}
